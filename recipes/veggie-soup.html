    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegetable soup is a hearty and nutritious dish made by simmering a 
        variety of fresh vegetables in a savory broth. 
        Common ingredients include carrots, celery, potatoes, 
        and onions, often seasoned with herbs and spices. 
        It’s a comforting and versatile soup that can be enjoyed
         on its own or as a side.

        It’s typically enriched with garlic, bay leaves, 
        and a splash of vinegar or lemon juice for added depth 
        of flavor. The result is a warming, flavorful soup that’s both
         satisfying and packed with vitamins, ideal for a light lunch
          or a wholesome dinner.
