# odin-recipes
This project serves as a means to display the basic html website made with texts, images and lists.
Out of the three recipes displayed in this html code, I chose one starter, one main course meal and one dessert to top it all of.
I hope I could revist this later to redesign it as I learn more skills with CSS and the like :)
